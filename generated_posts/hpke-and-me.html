<h5><em>An intro into Hybrid Public Key Encryption</em></h5>
<h2>Symmetric Key Encryption: A Refresher</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In all of us lives two wolves: asymmetric and symmetric encryption.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Symmetric key</strong> encryption is the simplest and oldest form of secure communication. It dates back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar days</a>. 
The Caesar cipher is a encryption scheme that encrypts messages by applying a fixed char "rotation" for each character in the plaintext. Messages can be decrypted by applying the reverse of the "rotation key". These days keys are a lot more complex, but the idea of sharing a single key to decrypt AND encrypt a message still stands. </p>
<p>Symmetric key encryption is cheap and efficient, but it has its draw backs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is no authentication that the sender is who they say they are. <em>Anyone</em> with the encryption key could send a message impersonating the sender and the recepient would have no clue. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This concept is known as "non-repudiation".</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scaling symmetric key communication is a nightmare. If one wanted to communicate with a <em>group</em> of individuals, each member of that group would need their own private key to communicate with each other. The number of keys needed scales non-linearly:</p>
<pre><code>- 2 users (*1 key* A-&gt;B)
- 3 users (*3 keys* {A-&gt;B, A-&gt;C, B-&gt;C})
- 4 users (*6 keys* {A-&gt;B, A-&gt;C, A-&gt;D, B-&gt;C, B-&gt;D, C-&gt;D})
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"Uh, why don't they just use the <em>same</em> symmetric key?" -You (Probably)
<strong>You (Probably):</strong> "Uh, why don't they just use the same symmetric key?"</p>
<p>If every individual in the party uses the same key, if that key is
compromised <em>everyone's</em> communication is compromised. This is unacceptable in
nearly all scenarios.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code> - If every individual in the party uses the same key, if that key is compormised *everyone's* communication is compromised. This is unacceptable in nearly all scenarios.
