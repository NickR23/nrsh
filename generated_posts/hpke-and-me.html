<h2>Symmetric Key Encryption: A Refresher</h2>
<p>Symmetric key encrytpion is the simplest and oldest form of secure communication. The paradigm dates back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar days</a>. Essentially, one party, Alice, sends another party, Bob, a key that can be used to decrypt the messages Alice send. This form of encryption is cheap and efficient, but it has its draw backs.</p>
