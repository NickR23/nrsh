## Symmetric Key Encryption: A Refresher

  Symmetric key encryption is the simplest and oldest form of secure communication. The paradigm dates back to the [Caesar days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). Essentially, one party, Alice, sends another party, Bob, a key that can be used to decrypt the messages Alice send. This form of encryption is cheap and efficient, but it has its draw backs.

  In all of us lives two wolves: assymettric and symmtetric encryption.
